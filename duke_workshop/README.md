This coming Tuesday I'll teach the basics of text analysis in Python with Spacy and Numpy. It will be in workshop format and we can all use a small dataset of US National Security Strategy documents produced by both Trump and Obama. Using SpaCy I'll show you how to use tokenization, Named Entity Recognition, Part of Speech Tagging, and grammatical Parse Trees on your text corpora. Then using Sklearn and Numpy matrices I'll show you how to build bag-of-word document matrices, build topic models, calculate pointwise mutual information representations, and build very basic word embedding models. Finally, I'll show a fun example of an "actor network" built from subject-verb-object triplets to compare the two national security strategy documents for their narrative content.
I'll probably prepare a few slides for conceptual explanation, and most of the workshop will be based on coding examples I placed on GitHub: we'll cover notebooks 1-3 I posted there. I also attached screenshots and Gephi files of the actor networks we'll make in the last part of the workshop, just in case it may pique your interest haha. Hope to see you there :slightly_smiling_face:
